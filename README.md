Neural Interview Audiolizer is a **".txt to .wav converter"** that turns textual dialogue (e.g. an interview, a chat) between two individuals to audio dialogue with two freely selectable voices, currently using either 
- [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) (wavenet voices only)
- [Amazon Polly Text-to-Speech API](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/) (neural engine voices only)
- [Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-to-speech/) (neural voices only).

It was made to run in [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (i.e. your browser), using [your Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive) as data source and storage.

**Note that you will need access with necessary access keys to use either one of the provided TTS APIs.** More information on obtaining access
- to Google Cloud TTS API: [Before you begin](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/quickstart-client-libraries#before-you-begin)
- to Amazon Polly TTS API: [AWS Account and Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html)
- to Microsoft Azure TTS API: [Create the Azure resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/overview#create-the-azure-resource)

## Input text
Input should be path to a .txt file located in your Google Drive, containing the dialogue in one of the following formats, with no other text. If your input material is a copy-paste from the interwebs, make sure to clean it up first to strictly follow one of these formats.
1) `question_and_answer` expects an empty line between every time speaker changes. 
2) `dialogue_with_names` expects `Name:` (e.g. _John: Hello Bob! How are you?_) every time speaker changes. Speaker is changed despite the name in the beginning, i.e. if there are two consecutive lines beginning with _John:_, the notebook will still interpret the second as _Bob_, and your result is messed up. This will be improved in the distant future, perhaps.

See [the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/olaviinha/NeuralInterviewAudiolizer/blob/main/NeuralInterviewAudiolizer.ipynb) for more details.

## Languages
This notebook has only English and Finnish voices by default. To add other languages, add the correct language names to `p1_voice` and `p2_voice` menus from [Google Cloud TTS voice list](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices), [Amazon Polly TTS voice list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/voicelist.html) or [Microsoft Azure TTS voice list](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-support#text-to-speech)
